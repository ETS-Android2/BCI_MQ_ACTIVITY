I think the immediate next steps would be:
•	Validate the EEG signal data 
•	Fix bugs and comment the code
•	Clean up and modularize the code 
•	Move from AsyncTask Background task to long running Threads
•	Add Timestamps to data 
•	Setup the Message/Queue/Broker to be persistent
•	Write a module in the app to passively collect data from phone sensors (accelerometer, location etc.)

Then I would need to look at Data Persistence
•	Cold Storage for historical data persistence (Hadoop?)
•	Hot Storage for near real-time data persistence (MongoDB or Spark?) 
•	Historic Raw EEG Data Processing and Visualization 
•	Near Real-Time EEG Data Processing and Visualization.
